# ATM_SIMULATOR

TITLE: ATM SIMULATOR


Objectives: 
This project has to simulate most of the activities which happen at an ATM. It is assumed that the 
account details of all the account holders would be stored in a file which gets used by this 
simulator.
i) Log in using a username and a password. 
ii) Look at the balance statement 
iii) Withdraw money - the balance should be checked and updated. 
iv) Allow the user to change the password (PIN) 
v) Deposit money 

Description : 
The aim of this ATM(Automated teller machine) simulator project is to build a c programming based 
simulation system based on the concept of managing cash transactions of a personal account .
Here we try to present the same scenario as the real atm that hands all user interaction with the bank 
server after successful login (after entering the pin) and henceforth carry on the above mentioned 
features as per requirement. 

Status of Implementation: 
As a part of phase 1 of the project we have included the login part with only 1 user whose pin is 
already initialized in the code . We have taken up 
1).To check the balance in the account
2). Withdraw money - the balance will be checked and updated.
3). Deposit money and thus update the balance.
The main concept implemented here is the “loops” in c .

At the end of the project the user will be able to make a valid login into his account and there will be a display of the balance in his account along with options to withdraw and deposit the amount and show the updated balance the the csv sheet provided.
This is just a replica of how the interface in banks work and to explore more about the looping structers of the programming language.
